# Embedded-SensorData

The Sensor Data is an embedded project running on an FRDM-K64F with a MBED Application Shield.

This project uses sensors like temperature sensor, accelerometer/magnetometer, LED, potentiometer, joysticks, and buttons.

Through a menu and joysticks, users can measure the temperature of a room, use a compass or even play music (Spirited Away theme song). The Sensor Data can also change the LEDs color by using the potentiometers.

Functionalities:

- Temperature Sensor

- Compass

- Music box

- Potentiometer that changes LED colours

Libraries used: C12832, eCompass_FPU_Lib, FXOS8700Q, LM75B
